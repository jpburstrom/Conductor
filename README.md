This is a clone of Ronald Kuivila's Conductor library, a collection of sclang classes for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), a programming environment and audio-synthesis engine. Due to recent changes in sclang (the programming language used within SuperCollider) I needed to apply some fixes that are not contained yet in the original version of Conductor.
The original Conductor library can be installed from within SuperCollider's inbuilt [quarks package manager](http://sourceforge.net/p/quarks/code/HEAD/tree/). However, the quarks-version will very likely not work properly with the current development version of SuperCollider (3.7alpha0).
